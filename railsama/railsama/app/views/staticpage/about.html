	<h2> About This Site </h2> 
 	<p> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAMA">AMAs</a> (short for "Ask Me Anything") allow anyone with a 
	<a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> account to interview celebrities,
	authors, and other notable figures. Popular AMAs are littered with tangential chatter and unanswered 
	questions. Scrolling through all that can get annoying, particularly on a phone or tablet. Enter the URL of an
	AMA, and this website will show you only the comments you care about - all in a clean, readable, Q and A
	format.
